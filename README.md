# Deriving the Nine-Mode-Model

We use **sympy** to derive the symbolic ordinary differential equations (ODE) for:

A low-dimensional model for turbulent shear flows

## Exemplary Output

Output will be the ODEs for the nine modes as a function of alpha, gamma and Re.
The transition to a numeric equation as well as a simple numeric solution are included as well.

A exemplary solution to the equations looks like:
